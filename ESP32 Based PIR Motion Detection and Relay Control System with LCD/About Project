This project demonstrates a smart motion detection system using a PIR sensor, relay module, and I2C LCD display 🚨⚡. Whenever human motion is detected, the system automatically turns ON a relay and displays the real-time status on the LCD screen 📟✅.
The PIR sensor acts as the motion detector 🏃‍♂️, the ESP32 works as the main controller 🧠, the relay controls an external device 🔌, and the LCD provides live visual feedback to the user.
This project is ideal for security systems, smart lighting, and automation applications 🏠🤖.

⚙️👀 Working of PIR Sensor
The PIR sensor works on the principle of infrared radiation detection 🔥:

1️⃣ The PIR sensor continuously monitors infrared energy in its surroundings 👀
2️⃣ When a human or warm object moves, the infrared pattern changes 🏃‍♂️
3️⃣ The PIR sensor sends a HIGH signal (1) to the ESP32 ✅
4️⃣ When no motion is detected, it sends a LOW signal (0) ❌

🔁⚡ System Working

📍 The ESP32 reads the PIR sensor value
📟 The value is displayed on the LCD screen
🔌 If motion is detected (PIR = 1):
✅ Relay turns ON
✅ LCD shows “Relay ON”
✅ Motion is confirmed

🔕 If no motion is detected (PIR = 0):
❌ Relay turns OFF
❌ LCD shows “Relay OFF”

The system updates every 1 second ⏱️ for stable and smooth operation.
