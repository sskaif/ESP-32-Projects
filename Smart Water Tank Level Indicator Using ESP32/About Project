💧 Real-Time Water Level Percentage Display Using ESP32 & Ultrasonic Sensor

This project demonstrates a smart water tank monitoring system using an ESP32 🧠 and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor 📡. 
The system continuously measures water level and calculates the percentage full 📊.
Visual and audio alerts notify users of water level conditions, making it perfect for home or industrial water tank monitoring 🏠🏭.

⚡ Components Used

ESP32 Dev Board 🧠

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) 📡
16×2 I2C LCD 📟
LEDs (Red 🔴, Yellow 🟡, Green 🟢)
Buzzer 🔔
220Ω resistors
Wires & Breadboard

🔧 Working of the System

1️⃣ ESP32 triggers the ultrasonic sensor ⚡
2️⃣ Sensor emits ultrasonic waves that bounce off the water surface 🎯
3️⃣ The Echo pin receives the reflected signal 🔊
4️⃣ ESP32 calculates distance to water surface using the speed of sound 📏
5️⃣ Converts distance into water level percentage (0–100%) 🔄

💡 Visual & Audio Indicators
Water Level	Indicator
< 20%	🔴 Red LED ON (Low Water)
20–79%	🟡 Yellow LED ON (Medium Water)
≥ 80%	🟢 Green LED ON + 🔔 Buzzer (Full Tank)
📟 LCD Display

Displays only water level percentage in real-time.

Example:
Water Level
65 %
