🌞🔄 ESP32 Based Automatic Light Controlled Servo System

This project demonstrates a smart light-based automation system using an ESP32 microcontroller, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), and a Servo Motor 🤖⚙️.
The system automatically rotates the servo motor based on the surrounding light intensity, making it fully automatic and intelligent ✅.

🧠⚡ How the System Works

The ESP32 acts as the brain of the system 🧠
The LDR sensor continuously senses the light intensity 🌞🌙

Based on the light level:
The ESP32 reads the analog value from the LDR 📊
The value is mapped into a servo angle (0°–180°) 🔄
The servo motor rotates automatically according to the light ✅
This makes the system dynamic and responsive to light conditions 🤖✨

🔍🌞 Working of LDR (Simple)

1️⃣ LDR changes its resistance based on light 🌞🌙
2️⃣ More light → Lower resistance ✅
3️⃣ Less light → Higher resistance ✅
4️⃣ ESP32 reads this change as an analog value 📈
5️⃣ The servo angle changes based on this value 🔄

🚦🔁 Automatic Servo Behavior

🌞 Bright Light → Servo rotates towards one extreme angle (e.g., 180°)

🌙 Low Light/Darkness → Servo rotates back to 0°

🔁 The movement is smooth and continuous as light changes
