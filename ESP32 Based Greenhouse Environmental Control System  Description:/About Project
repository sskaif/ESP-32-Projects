🌱 ESP32 Greenhouse Automation System
A smart Greenhouse Automation System using ESP32 that automatically controls a fan, water pump, and grow light based on real-time sensor values. The project is fully offline and simulated using Wokwi.

🚀 Project Overview
This project monitors key environmental parameters required for plant growth and automatically takes action:

🌡️ Temperature → Controls the cooling fan
💧 Soil Moisture (via Potentiometer) → Controls the water pump
🌞 Light Intensity (via LDR) → Controls the grow light
The system reduces manual effort and helps maintain optimal conditions inside a greenhouse.

🔧 Components Used

ESP32 Dev Board
DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
Potentiometer (Soil Moisture Simulation)
LEDs (Fan, Pump, Grow Light indicators)

Wokwi Simulator

⚙️ Working Principle
🌡️ Temperature-Based Fan Control

The DHT22 sensor continuously measures temperature.
If temperature > 30°C, the fan turns ON 🌀
If temperature ≤ 30°C, the fan turns OFF
💧 Soil Moisture-Based Water Pump
A potentiometer simulates soil moisture
If soil value is low (dry) → pump turns ON 💦
If soil value is high (wet) → pump turns OFF

🌞 Light-Based Grow Light Control

The LDR detects light intensity.
If light is low (night/dark) → grow light turns ON 💡
If light is sufficient (day) → grow light turns OFF

🖥️ Simulation & Testing
