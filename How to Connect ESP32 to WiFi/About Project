📶📟 ESP32 WiFi Connection Status Indicator Using LCD & LEDs

This project demonstrates a smart WiFi connection status system using an ESP32 microcontroller, 16×2 I2C LCD display, and two LEDs 💡🔴🔵.
The system visually shows the WiFi connection process and status using LEDs and also displays the IP address on the LCD screen after successful connection 🌐✅.

🧠⚡ How the System Works

The ESP32 acts as the brain of the system 🧠
The board tries to connect to a WiFi network (Wokwi-GUEST) 📡

While connecting:
Red LED blinks 🔴
LCD shows “Connecting…” ⏳
Once connected:
Blue LED turns ON 🔵
LCD shows “Connected” ✅

The IP Address is displayed on the LCD 🌐

🚦💡 LED Status Indication Logic

🔴 Red LED Blinking
➡️ WiFi is trying to connect

🔵 Blue LED ON
➡️ WiFi is successfully connected ✅

This makes the system easy to understand even without a computer 👀✅

📟🌐 LCD Display Operation
The 16×2 LCD shows:
Line 1: Connection status (Connecting... / Connected)
Line 2: ESP32 local IP address (after connection)
This helps in real-time network monitoring 📊✅
