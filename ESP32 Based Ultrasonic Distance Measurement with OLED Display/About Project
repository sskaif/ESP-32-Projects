📏🖥️ ESP32 Based Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with OLED Display

This project demonstrates a real-time distance measurement system using an Ultrasonic Sensor, ESP32 microcontroller, and a 128×64 OLED display 🤖✨.
The system continuously measures the distance of an object and displays the value clearly on the OLED screen in centimeters 📊✅.

🧠⚡ How the System Works

The ESP32 acts as the brain of the system 🧠
It sends trigger pulses to the Ultrasonic Sensor 📡
The sensor receives the reflected echo signal 🔊
The ESP32 calculates the distance using the speed of sound formula 📐
The measured distance is then displayed on the OLED screen in real time 🖥️✅

📡🔊 Working of Ultrasonic Sensor (Simple)

1️⃣ ESP32 sends a 10 microsecond HIGH pulse to the Trigger pin ⚡
2️⃣ The sensor emits ultrasonic sound waves (40 kHz) 📢
3️⃣ These waves hit the object and reflect back 🎯
4️⃣ The Echo pin receives the reflected signal 🔁
5️⃣ ESP32 measures the time and calculates distance using:

📐 Distance = (Time × Speed of Sound) / 2

Since the sound travels to the object and back, the value is divided by 2 🔄✅

🖥️📊 OLED Display Operation

✅ The OLED shows:
