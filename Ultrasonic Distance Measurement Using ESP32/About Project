📏✨ ESP32 Based Ultrasonic Distance Measurement System

This project demonstrates a real-time distance measurement system using an Ultrasonic Sensor and ESP32 microcontroller 🚀. The system measures the distance of an object by sending and receiving ultrasonic sound waves and displays the result on the Serial Monitor 📟.
The complete project is designed and tested in the Wokwi online simulator 💻, making it easy to test without physical hardware. This type of system is widely used in smart automation, robotics, safety systems, and IoT applications 🤖🌐.
The ESP32 controls the ultrasonic sensor using two GPIO pins:

✅ Trigger Pin – Sends the ultrasonic pulse
✅ Echo Pin – Receives the reflected signal

The distance is calculated using the speed of sound principle and is displayed in centimeters (cm).
⚙️📡 Working Principle of the Ultrasonic Sensor

The ultrasonic sensor works based on the Echo Reflection Method 🔁:

1️⃣ The ESP32 sends a 10 microsecond HIGH pulse to the Trigger pin ⚡
2️⃣ The sensor generates ultrasonic sound waves (40 kHz) 📢
3️⃣ These waves travel through air and hit an object 🎯
4️⃣ The waves get reflected back toward the sensor 🔊
5️⃣ The Echo pin receives the signal, and ESP32 measures the time using the pulseIn() function ⏱️
6️⃣ The distance is calculated using the formula:

📐 Distance = (Time × Speed of Sound) / 2
The time is divided by 2 because the sound travels to the object and back 🔄.
