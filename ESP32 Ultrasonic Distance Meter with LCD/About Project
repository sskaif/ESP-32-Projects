📏🖥️ ESP32 Based Ultrasonic Distance Measurement with LCD Display

This project demonstrates a real-time distance measurement system using an Ultrasonic Sensor and ESP32 microcontroller, where the measured distance is displayed on an LCD screen 📟. The system measures the distance of an object using sound waves and shows the result instantly in centimeters (cm) on the LCD.
The ESP32 acts as the main controller 🧠, sending trigger signals to the ultrasonic sensor and processing the echo response. This project is designed and tested using the Wokwi online simulator 💻, making it easy to simulate and debug without physical hardware.
This project is widely used in automation, robotics, smart dustbins, parking systems, and IoT applications 🤖🌐.

⚙️📡 Working of the Ultrasonic Sensor

The ultrasonic sensor works on the echo reflection principle 🔁:

1️⃣ ESP32 sends a 10µs HIGH pulse to the Trigger pin ⚡
2️⃣ The sensor emits ultrasonic sound waves (40 kHz) 📢
3️⃣ The waves travel through air and hit an object 🎯
4️⃣ The sound reflects back to the sensor 🔊
5️⃣ The Echo pin receives the signal, and ESP32 measures the time ⏱️
6️⃣ Distance is calculated using the formula:

📐 Distance = (Time × Speed of Sound) / 2
The division by 2 is done because the sound travels to the object and back 🔄.
🖥️📊 LCD Display Operation
The calculated distance value is sent to the LCD display, where it is shown in real-time ✅. This allows the user to visually monitor the object distance without using a computer.
