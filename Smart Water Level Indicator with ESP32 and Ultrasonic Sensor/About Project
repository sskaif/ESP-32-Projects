💧📟 Ultrasonic Water Level Monitoring System Using ESP32, LEDs & Buzzer

This project demonstrates a smart water level monitoring system using an Ultrasonic Sensor, ESP32, 16×2 I2C LCD, 5 LEDs, and a Buzzer 🚀🤖.
The system continuously measures the water level (distance) and shows the level visually using LEDs and digitally on the LCD screen 📊💡.
When the water reaches a critical level, a buzzer alert is activated 🔊🚨.

🧠⚡ How the System Works

The ESP32 acts as the main controller 🧠
The Ultrasonic Sensor measures the distance between the water surface and sensor 📏
Based on this distance:
Different LEDs glow to indicate water level 💡💡💡
The LCD displays the real-time water level value 📟
The buzzer turns ON during warning conditions 🚨

📡🔊 Working of Ultrasonic Sensor (Simple)

1️⃣ ESP32 sends a 10μs pulse to the Trigger pin ⚡
2️⃣ The sensor sends ultrasonic sound waves (40 kHz) 📢
3️⃣ Waves hit the water surface and reflect back 🔁
4️⃣ The Echo pin receives the reflected signal ⏱️
5️⃣ ESP32 calculates distance using:

📐 Distance = (Time × Speed of Sound) / 2

This gives the exact water level distance ✅

🚦💡 Water Level Indication Logic
🔴 Distance < 10 cm (Tank Almost Full)

✅ LED 5 ON
🚨 Buzzer ON (Danger Alert)
📟 LCD shows water level
👉 Overflow Warning

🟠 Distance < 30 cm (High Level)

✅ LED 5 & LED 4 ON
🔕 Buzzer OFF
📟 LCD shows water level

🟡 Distance < 50 cm (Medium Level)

✅ LED 5, LED 4 & LED 3 ON
🔕 Buzzer OFF
📟 LCD shows water level

🟢 Distance > 50 cm (Low Water Level)

✅ All LEDs ON
🚨 Buzzer ON (Low Water Alert)
📟 LCD shows water level

This makes the system fully automatic & intelligent 🤖✅

📟🖥️ LCD Display Function

The LCD shows:

"WaterLevel" text

Live distance value in cm
This allows real-time monitoring without a computer ✅
