🔘⚙️ ESP32 Based Push Button Controlled Servo Motor System
This project demonstrates a push button controlled servo motor system using an ESP32 microcontroller 🧠⚡. With every button press, the servo motor rotates between 0° and 90°, allowing precise and automatic position control 🔄.
The project uses the ESP32Servo library to control the servo motor and the ezButton library for clean and noise-free button input (debouncing) 🛠️. This ensures stable and reliable operation ✅.

⚙️🔁 Working Principle

1️⃣ The push button acts as an input device 🔘
2️⃣ When the button is pressed, the ezButton library detects the press event ✅
3️⃣ The ESP32 checks the current angle of the servo motor ⚙️
4️⃣ If the servo is at 0°, it rotates to 90° 📐
5️⃣ If the servo is at 90°, it rotates back to 0° 🔄
6️⃣ The servo motor position is updated using the myservo.write(angle) command
7️⃣ The debounce time of 50 ms ensures smooth and error-free operation ⏱️

This creates a toggle-based smart servo control system 🤖✅.

🚦🎯 System Behavior

🔘 First Button Press → Servo moves to 90° 📐
🔘 Next Button Press → Servo returns to 0° 🔄
➡️ The process repeats with every button press
