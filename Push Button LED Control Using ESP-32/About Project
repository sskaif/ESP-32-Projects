🔘💡 ESP32 Based Button Controlled LED System
This project demonstrates a simple digital control system where an LED is controlled using a push button with an ESP32 microcontroller 🧠⚡. When the button is pressed, the LED turns ON, and when the button is released, the LED turns OFF ✅❌.
The project uses the ezButton library to handle button debouncing 🛠️, which avoids false triggering caused by mechanical noise in the push button. This makes the system stable, accurate, and reliable ✅.

⚙️🔁 Working Principle

1️⃣ The push button acts as an input device 🔘
2️⃣ When the button is pressed, the ezButton library detects the press event ✅
3️⃣ The ESP32 then sends a HIGH signal to the LED pin ⚡
4️⃣ The LED turns ON immediately 💡
5️⃣ When the button is released, the ESP32 sends a LOW signal, and the LED turns OFF ❌
6️⃣ The debounce time of 50 ms ensures clean and noise-free operation ⏱️

🚦💡 System Behavior

🔘 Button Pressed → ✅ LED ON 💡
✋ Button Released → ❌ LED OFF

This makes the system simple, fast, and fully responsive 🤖✅.
