📱📡 ESP32 Based Bluetooth Controlled RGB LED System

This project demonstrates a wireless RGB LED control system using an ESP32 microcontroller and Bluetooth communication 🤖📶.
Using a smartphone and a Bluetooth app, the user can turn ON/OFF and change the color of LEDs remotely without any physical switch ✅🎨.

🧠⚡ How the System Works

The ESP32 acts as the main controller 🧠
It creates a Bluetooth device that pairs with a mobile phone 📱
The user sends single-character commands (r, g, b, 1, 0) from the phone
The ESP32 receives these commands via Bluetooth 📡

Based on the command:
The corresponding LED turns ON or OFF instantly 💡
This makes the system completely wireless and smart 🤖✅

🎮📲 Bluetooth Control Commands
Command	Action
r	🔴 Red LED ON
g	🟢 Green LED ON
b	🔵 Blue LED ON
1	⚪ All LEDs ON
0	⚫ All LEDs OFF
🔁🔌 RGB LED Control Logic

✅ Only one color LED glows at a time when r, g, or b is sent
✅ When 1 is sent → All LEDs turn ON (White light) ⚪
✅ When 0 is sent → All LEDs turn OFF 🌑
✅ All control happens wirelessly via Bluetooth 📡📱
